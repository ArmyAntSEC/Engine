A snapshot of my extra-credit assignment for my Java programming course at KTH, ca 2001. 
Since this is a snapshot, it contains the compiled class files as well as the javadocs, even if these are technically generatable from the source. Not sure if moder Java would still compile these.

Also, this is an applet, and no browser supports those any more... so hard to see it in action.
